# Google Foobar Challenge 2020.

This is my take on the 'Foobar' challenge by Google.

I've arranged the problems as they were presented to me by Google. You can easily navigate through each of the folders to have a look at the code.
Some folders have a <b>'Trial'</b> solution too which is nothing but an initial try to the problem. These are generally the brute force approaches which do not pass all the test cases.
The other files are the accepted ones which involve a specific algorithm, method or simply mathematics.

### Note
1. All solutions are in python. I'm a python guy you see.
2. For some of the solutions, I have taken help of the internet and hence some can be strikingly similar to them.
3. Soon I plan on initializing a <b>ReadMe</b> file for every problem containing some learnings, tips, tricks & resources regarding that problem. These will be folder specific.
